/*
	This is a test adventure file
	It is not intended to be used as a real adventure but to test the compiler/parser

	Author: queru (github.com/queru) 2025

	Notes:
		- The adv files should be written in UTF-8 encoding.
		- Comments are written using the // symbol, the rest of the line is ignored.
		- Multiline comments are written using the /* and */ symbols, but should start at the beginning of the line.
		- The compiler will ignore empty lines or lines starting with a comment.
		- All the keywords are case insensitive.
		- The labels and variable namesare case sensitive. Labels cannot be duplicated in or between sections.
		- Includes are relative to the current file, they points the compiler inmediately to the file to the file and
		  returns to the current file after processing it.
		- All the variables are global, they can be accessed from any part of the code but they are declared and
		  initialized in the 'VARS' section.
		- Variables are strongly typed but type is infered from the declaration:
			v = 10 (int)
			v = 1.5 (float)
			v = "aventure" (string)
			v = true (bool)
			v = false (bool)
			v = "Hello, $1.\nWelcome to $2.\n" (string with interpolated arguments)
		- Ints and floats are signed 32 or 64 bits long, depending on the architecture.
		- Sections are: VARS, WORDS, MESSAGES, SYSMESSAGES, OBJECTS, LOCATIONS, PROCESS TABLES.
